# Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
Introduction

This project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we can gain valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices and create a predictive tool for real estate professionals and potential homebuyers.   

Data Preparation

Data Acquisition: Gather a dataset containing information on house prices, square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. Ensure the dataset is representative and covers a diverse range of properties.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data to ensure its quality and reliability.
Feature Engineering: Consider creating additional features that might be relevant to house prices, such as proximity to schools, amenities, or transportation.
Model Building

Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Linear Regression: Create a linear regression model using a suitable library like scikit-learn in Python.
Model Training: Fit the model to the training data, learning the relationship between the features and the target variable (house price).
Model Evaluation

Metrics: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Visualization: Create visualizations like scatter plots to understand the relationship between the features and the predicted house prices.
Cross-Validation: Employ cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization ability and prevent overfitting.
Model Deployment

Deployment: Deploy the trained model to a suitable environment (e.g., web application, API) for making predictions on new data.
Integration: Integrate the model into real-world applications, such as real estate websites or mobile apps.
Conclusion

Summarize the key findings and results of the project. Discuss the limitations of the model and potential areas for improvement. Highlight the potential applications of the model in the real estate industry.

Code Snippets

Python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('house_prices.csv')   


# Split the data into features and target variable
X = data[['square_footage', 'num_bedrooms', 'num_bathrooms']]
y = data['price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y,   
 test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print('Mean Squared Error:', mse)   

Use code with caution.

Remember to replace 'house_prices.csv' with the actual path to your dataset. You can also explore other evaluation metrics and visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into your model's performance.
